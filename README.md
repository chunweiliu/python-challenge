# Python Challenge
My approach to the Python Challenge at http://www.pythonchallenge.com/.

I wrote one script for each challenge with name `pc_<#challenge>.py`. Each script follows the format:

    """
    <the URL for the challenge>

    <description of the challenge>
    """
    
    <my approach>

    <the ANSWER URL for the next challenge>

The URL for the next challenge would be printed after running the script.

Currently I solved the challenges from 0-6, and I might not continually work on the challenges.
